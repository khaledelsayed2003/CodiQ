                    <h3>Why We Built CodiQ</h3>
                    <p>As learners ourselves, we understand how challenging it can be to test your knowledge and track your progress while learning to code. That’s why we created <strong>CodiQ</strong>—a platform where you can take quizzes on various programming languages, challenge yourself, and see how far you’ve come.</p>

                    <p>This project started as a way for us to apply what we’ve learned about web development. From brainstorming ideas to writing code and solving problems, every step of building CodiQ has been a learning experience for us. We’re proud of what we’ve accomplished so far, and we’re excited to continue improving the platform with your feedback.</p>
